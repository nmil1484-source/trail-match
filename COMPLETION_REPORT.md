## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
- TypeScript LSP cache errors (don't affect runtime)
  - `getAllShopsAdmin`, `deleteUser`, `deleteShop`, `updateUserRole` show as missing
  - These are false positives from stale TypeScript cache
  - Runtime works perfectly, functions exist and are exported
  - Fix: Restart TypeScript server or ignore (doesn't affect production)

### Google Places API
- Requires billing enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Requires both "Maps JavaScript API" and "Places API" enabled
- API key restrictions should allow your domain
